			For this milestone, I added a "Favorite Order" page for my website.
			This is the first step to upgrade my website, as this would keep a list of the user's favorite dishes and well as their quantity.
			For future plan, I plan to let users create their own accounts. If each person has his/her own favorite order, customers won't have to go 
			though the process of ordering each of their favorite item sepately anymore, hence making the website more convenient for users.
			<br />

			I used a database to store the customer's favorite order. Users are provided with input forms. After taking the input, my program
			uses PHP to interact with the database. In particular, inputs are cleaned to avoid HTML injection as well as SQL injection before they 
			are added to the database, and later displayed in a table. 
			<br />
			In terms of HTML injection, I used the function htmlspecialchars to convert special characters to HTML entities. 
			Regarding
			SQL injection, I used prepared statements in PDO, which are known to be useful against SQL attack. I also check the user's 
			input with regular expression to make sure enter the correct format.

			Definition (CREATE TABLE sql) of my table: <br />
            <div>
                CREATE TABLE Menu ( <br />
                ID INTEGER UNSIGNED NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, <br />
                Name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, <br />
                Quantity INTEGER UNSIGNED NOT NULL  <br />
                );
            </div>
