			For this milestone, I upgraded my website so that it is possible for customers to order food.
			I used number input fields, with the values ranging from 0 to 100 for security reasons. I let the users type
			in their address to complete the order. These fields are required. I also checked the validity of user's
			inputs.
			<br />
			After the users submit the order, I will process the order and display the order summary to the users. This
			includes the customer's address, method of payment, the total number of items and the total amount that
			customers need to pay.
			<br />

			Here are the links to the files involved:
